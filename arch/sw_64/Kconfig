config KEXEC

	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your

	  but it is independent of the system firmware. And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you. As of this writing the exact hardware
	  interface is strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be
	  made.

config CRASH_DUMP

	  This should be normally only set in special crash dump kernels

	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications

	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP), it cannot be disabled

	help
	  This option provides support for runtime services provided

config DMI

	  This enables SMBIOS/DMI feature for systems.

	  This option is only useful on systems that have UEFI firmware.
	  However, even with this option, the resultant kernel should
	  continue to boot on existing non-UEFI platforms.

	  NOTE: This does *NOT* enable or encourage the use of DMI quirks,
	  i.e., the practice of identifying the platform via DMI to
	  decide whether certain workarounds for buggy hardware and/or
	  firmware need to be enabled. This would require the DMI subsystem
	  to be enabled much earlier than we do on ARM, which is non-trivial.

config CMDLINE_BOOL
	bool "Built-in kernel command line"
	help
	  Allow for specifying boot arguments to the kernel at

	  necessary or convenient to provide some or all of the
	  kernel boot arguments with the kernel itself (that is,
	  to not rely on the boot loader to provide them.)

	  To compile command line arguments into the kernel,
	  set this option to 'Y', then fill in the
	  boot arguments in CONFIG_CMDLINE.

	  Systems with fully functional boot loaders (i.e. non-embedded)
	  should leave this option set to 'N'.

config CMDLINE
	string "Built-in kernel command string"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	default ""
	help
	  Enter arguments here that should be compiled into the kernel
	  image and used at boot time. If the boot loader provides a
	  command line at boot time, it is appended to this string to
	  form the full kernel command line, when the system boots.

	  However, you can use the CONFIG_CMDLINE_OVERRIDE option to
	  change this behavior.

	  In most cases, the command line (whether built-in or provided
	  by the boot loader) should specify the device for the root
	  file system.

config CMDLINE_OVERRIDE
	bool "Built-in command line overrides boot loader arguments"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	help
	  Set this option to 'Y' to have the kernel ignore the boot loader
	  command line, and use ONLY the built-in command line.

	  This is used to work around broken boot loaders. This should
	  be set to 'N' under normal conditions.

config FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER
	int
	default "16" if (HUGETLB_PAGE)
	default "11"
	help
	  The kernel memory allocator divides physically contiguous memory
	  blocks into "zones", where each zone is a power of two number of
	  pages. This option selects the largest power of two that the kernel
	  keeps in the memory allocator. If you need to allocate very large
	  blocks of physically contiguous memory, then you may need to
	  increase this value.

	  This config option is actually maximum order plus one. For example,
	  a value of 11 means that the largest free memory block is 2^10 pages.

	  We make sure that we can allocate upto a HugePage size for each configuration.
	  Hence we have :
		MAX_ORDER = (PMD_SHIFT - PAGE_SHIFT) + 1 => PAGE_SHIFT - 2
